#  Unity Post Processing Stack Classic (PPSC) v1.x (Built-in Render Pipeline)

![GitHub Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvjob/nvjob.github.io/master/repo/unity%20assets/ppsc/pic/0.jpg)

This is the first version ("classic") of the Post-processing stack that was removed from the Unity Asset Store due to incompatibility with newer Unity versions.<br>
I introduced some changes that fix incompatibility with newer versions of Unity. I also reduced the size of the asset.<br>
I like this version of the Post-processing stack and I use it mainly in my projects. Therefore, I will try to support this version, for compatibility with current versions of Unity.

### Information
The post-processing stack is an effect that combines a complete set of effects into a single post-processing pipeline.<br>
This has a few advantages:<br>
- Effects are always configured in the correct order<br>
- It allows a combination of many effects into a single pass<br>
- All effects are grouped together in the UI for a better user experience

The post-processing stack also includes a collection of monitors and debug views to help you set up your effects correctly and debug problems in the output.
